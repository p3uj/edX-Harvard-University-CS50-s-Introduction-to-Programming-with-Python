# 1. Indoor Voice
## 1. STATEMENT
### Gets user input and outputs it in lowercase.
#### Instruction
WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

Best to use your ‚Äúindoor voice‚Äù sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

## 1. MY SOLUTION
- [Gets user input and outputs it in lowercase.py](https://github.com/p3uj/edX-Harvard-University-CS50-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/blob/adcb51a8fc5a5789f9e74d3cb6e1c2f8d1f13ada/Problem%20Set%200/indoor-voice.py)


# 2. Playback Speed
## 2. STATEMENT
### Gets user input and outputs it with spaces replaced by three periods.
#### Instruction
Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it‚Äôd be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube‚Äôs 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

## 2. MY SOLUTION
- [Gets user input and outputs it with spaces replaced by three periods.py](https://github.com/p3uj/edX-Harvard-University-CS50-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/blob/ed02e025ac939fb20e41d9768d9afddb3bfd3083/Problem%20Set%200/playback.py)


# 3.Making Faces
## 3. STATEMENT
### Convert :) and :( to emoji
#### Instruction
Before there were emoji, there were emoticons, whereby text like :) was a happy face and text like :( was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on that input, and prints the result. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.

## 3. MY SOLUTION
- [Convert :) and :( to emoji.py](https://github.com/p3uj/edX-Harvard-University-CS50-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/blob/e6cb5745fb39544ac9f2f9b1b20a3c09d5266ddf/Problem%20Set%200/faces.py)


# 4. Einstein
## 4. STATEMENT
### E = mc¬≤
#### Instruction
Even if you haven‚Äôt studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that **E = mc¬≤**, wherein **E** represents energy (measured in Joules), **m** represents mass (measured in kilograms), and **c** represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.

In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

## 4. MY SOLUTION
- [E = mc¬≤.py](https://github.com/p3uj/edX-Harvard-University-CS50-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/blob/d347207a17adfd70c1a0362ee104517d3f3f40ac/Problem%20Set%200/einstein.py)


# 5. Tip Calculator
## 5. STATEMENT
### Calculate tip
#### Instruction
And now for my Wizard tip calculator.

‚Äî Morty Seinfeld

In the United States, it‚Äôs customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal‚Äôs cost. Not to worry, though, we‚Äôve written a tip calculator for you, below!


![Alt text](<Problem Set 0/Images/givenCode-Tip.png>)


Well, we‚Äôve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt have time to implement two functions:

Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.
