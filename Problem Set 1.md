# 1. Deep Thought
## 1. STATEMENT
### String user's Input and get the result of Yes or No
#### Instruction
    “All right,” said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
    “You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.
    “Tell us!”
    “All right,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great Question…”
    “Yes…!”
    “Of Life, the Universe and Everything…” said Deep Thought.
    “Yes…!”
    “Is…” said Deep Thought, and paused.
    “Yes…!”
    “Is…”
    “Yes…!!!…?”
    “Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”

In **deep.py**, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting **Yes** if the user inputs **42** or (case-insensitively) **forty-two** or **forty two**. Otherwise output **No**.

## 1. MY SOLUTION
- [String user's Input and get the result of Yes or No.py](https://github.com/p3uj/edX-Harvard-University-CS50-s-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/blob/b44a34123cc911d156f54ef464dd121ca6e8e503/Problem%20Set%201/deep.py)


# 2. Home Federal Savings Bank
## 2. STATEMENT
### Greeting and amount output
#### Instruction
In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

In a file called **bank.py**, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output **$0**. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output **$20**. Otherwise, output **$100**. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
